Agentic AI — Learning Project

This repository is my personal project for building an AI agent from scratch while learning agentic AI concepts through ReadyTensor AI
.

The repo grows step by step as I learn, covering everything from a minimal conversational agent to more advanced multi-tool, memory-powered agents.

🚀 Features (Work in Progress)

✅ Conversational agent (user input → LLM → reply)

✅ Basic memory (short conversation history)

✅ Tools (calculator, web requests, more coming)

🔄 Long-term memory (vector store, embeddings)

🔄 Multi-agent collaboration (planning, delegation)

🔄 Advanced autonomy (reason–act–reflect loop)

📖 Learning Journey (Inspired by ReadyTensor AI)

This repo is structured around my weekly learning path at ReadyTensor:

Week 1: Minimal agent loop

Week 2: Add tools (calculator, API calls)

Week 3: Short-term & long-term memory

Week 4: Reflection & autonomy

Week 5+: Multi-agent systems and advanced orchestration

🧩 Next Steps

Add vector database memory (FAISS or Pinecone)

Build a simple multi-agent setup (Planner + Worker)

Connect to real APIs (search, trading, etc.)

Deploy on a server or cloud function

🤝 Contribution

This is primarily a learning project, but feedback and suggestions are welcome.
